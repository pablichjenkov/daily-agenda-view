## Daily Agenda View
This is a compose view useful for Apps that needs to present daily events or daily activities type of functionality. The idea came out after searching for a daily calendar similar to Microsotf Outlook App for Android. There seems to be not many libraries offering this functionality and the ones that do do not meet all the requirements.

## Demo

## Future work
At the moment the library uses only on method for laying out the daily events. It lays out **even rows from left to right** and **odd rows from right to left**, maximizing the space available in small screens. But some App may want a different type of layout, like always from left to right or viceverse.
